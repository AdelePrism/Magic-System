Every Character has:

### A Maximum of 50 Health Points (HP)
If health reaches zero, you fall unconscious

## 10 Focus Points
Focus points get used to make spells. A spell takes up multiple points to be made, but whenever you rest you can rearrange what you spend your focus points on, by switching out spells. The amount of focus points you have always stays the same, and is only ever increased when you level up.

## A Maximum of 30 Magic Points
Magic points is a resource that you spend throughout a day to cast spells. It gets refilled whenever you rest. To cast a spell, it costs the amount of focus points a spell takes.
##### Casting spells on the fly
If a specific effect is needed, a player can make a spell to use once, at any time. The DM asks about what effects is desired, and decides how many magic points the spell will cost. When the player is ready to cast the spell, the effect happens, and the amount of magic points it costs is reduced from the total.
