## Effects:
- The spell creates a bubble that pops violently on a condition decided by the caster.
- The bubble floats still in the air, unless pushed by someone for a bonus action, in which case it gets moved to another space within 30ft, decided by the one pushing the bubble.
- When the bubble pops, everyone within 5ft of it takes 1d8 damage.
