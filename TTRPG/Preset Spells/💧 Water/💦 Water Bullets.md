- ### 1 Bonus Action to set up, 1 Action to fire
- ### 4 Focus Points to have access to the spell
- ### Varying Magic Points to cast depending on the amount of water bullets created

## Effects:
- The caster decides on how many magic points to spend on the spell.
- The caster condenses moisture in the air into 3 water droplets per magic point spent, and keeps them there until the spell is dismissed as a free action, or the caster runs out of droplets.
- While the spell is active, the caster can spend an action to fire up to 4 water bullets at a target within 30ft of the caster, by rolling an attack roll.
- On a hit, the target takes Xd6 damage, where X is the amount of water droplets spent on the attack.
