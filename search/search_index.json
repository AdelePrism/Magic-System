This lead to her getting sent to a city with a Shock mage academy, and getting enrolled. The academy was very standardized and taught exclusively shock mages. Samantha's teacher was stubborn and did not like the branches of shock magic that were not directly lightning and electricity. By the end of the final year, every student is required to have a sufficient \"\u26a1\ufe0fLightning Bolt Spell\" to graduate. Samantha dislikes this, because her proficiency in shock magic is mostly the aspects of velocity and speed. Her defiance affected her grades, as her form of magic wasn't counted as doing the coursework properly. This only further alienated her from her peers and from the academy. She exclusively worked on her own spells rather than what was expected of her. When she was nearing the end of her time at the academy, she made a simple ranged spell (\ud83d\udc49 Bang) that barely fit the requirements. Because of this, she was able to graduate at the age of 19, and went out traveling to learn more about magic and improve her skills. After 6 months of adventuring, she met Artemis, and they decided to travel together.</p>"},{"location":"Characters/Samantha/%F0%9F%93%9C%20Spells/%E2%8F%AF%EF%B8%8F%20Dash/","title":"\u23ef\ufe0f Dash","text":"<p>Element(s): \u26a1\ufe0f Shock</p>"},{"location":"Characters/Samantha/%F0%9F%93%9C%20Spells/%E2%8F%AF%EF%B8%8F%20Dash/#trigger","title":"Trigger","text":"<ul> <li>Visualizing herself moving for up to 5 seconds readies the spell.</li> <li>Blinking intentionally when its fully visualized triggers the spell.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Characters/Samantha/%F0%9F%93%9C%20Spells/%E2%8F%AF%EF%B8%8F%20Dash/#effect","title":"Effect","text":"<ul> <li>When she has a \"route\" or \"path\" visualized, triggering the spell makes her speed up to an immense degree, and performs the visualized set of movements in a flash.</li> <li>During the flash, she performs the movements automatically without thinking or processing things during.

This, however, is difficult and requires skill in making links.</p> <p>Examples of links:</p> Link name Link Description Inscription The most basic link for casting spells, and many mages' starting link, as it is easy to learn and cast. Writing the spell's instructions onto any surface. The inscription can be any language, as long as a clear meaning is conveyed from the writer. It lacks complexity however, as each aspect of the created spell needs to be written down, meaning its quite time consuming to do complex spells. An inscription can be reused if it has been written to do so. Verbal A common component for spells, the caster speaks a word or phrase as a trigger for the spell. Society standardizes common types of spells, so many people have spells named things such as \"Fireball\" or \"Heal\". Because the words spoken often represent the spell, an opponent can take advantage of this to prepare for the spell being cast, but this can be prevented by naming spells in unconventional or misleading ways. Somatic A relatively common link for casters, where the trigger is some sort of physical movement, such as a clap, a dance, or a hand gesture or other movement of the body. This type of link is not standardized, and the movements are often not clear enough to distinguish what it is before it happens. Mental Mental links are quite rare, but are immensely powerful. It includes any sort of explainable brain activity. For example, a phrase that is thought, feeling a certain emotion, or visualizing an object or a movement are all valid ways of using mental links. This link is the easiest to automate, since mental links are complex and cover a lot of the requirements that automating triggers need already."},{"location":"Magic/Basics%20of%20Magic/%F0%9F%A7%99%E2%80%8D%E2%99%80%EF%B8%8F%20Affinity/","title":"\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Affinity","text":"<p>Each Individual has a different affinity for magic.
