For a spellcaster to be able to use magic, they need a link, a connection to the soul of the element they are using.

The most basic and simple link a caster can make, is symbols and runes in the form of a text, known as inscriptions. These instructions tell the soul what the caster wants to do, and interprets it and turns it into a spell. This way of casting is unique in that it does not have a shorthand form for casting spells, each time a spell gets cast it needs the full instructions.

People can use anything as a link. As long as the soul, and the caster both understand and agree on a link, that link is made and can be used by the caster.

It is also possible to make spells get cast automatically, under a condition. This, however, is difficult and requires skill in making links.

Types of links:

|             Link name             |                                                                                                                                                                                                     Link Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| <font size=5>     **Inscription** |         The most basic link for casting spells, and many mages' starting link, as it is easy to learn and cast. Writing the spell's instructions onto any surface. The inscription can be any language, as long as a clear meaning is conveyed from the writer. It lacks complexity however, as each aspect of the created spell needs to be written down, meaning its quite time consuming to do complex spells.         |
|      <font size=5>**Verbal**      | A common component for spells, the caster speaks a word or phrase as a trigger for the spell. Society standardizes common types of spells, so many people have spells named such as "Fireball" or "Heal". Because the words spoken often represent the spell, an opponent can take advantage of this to prepare for the spell being cast, but this can be prevented by naming spells unconventional or misleading things. |
|     <font size=5>**Somatic**      |                                                           A relatively common link for casters, where the trigger is some sort of physical movement, such as a clap, a dance, or a hand gesture or other movement of the body. This type of link is not standardized, and the movements are often not clear enough to distinguish what it is before it happens.                                                           |
|      <font size=5>**Mental**      |          Mental links are quite rare, but are immensely powerful. It includes any sort of explainable brain activity. For example, a phrase that is thought, feeling a certain emotion, or visualizing an object or a movement are all valid ways of using mental links. This link is the easiest to automate, since mental links are complex and cover a lot of the requirements that automating triggers need.          |
