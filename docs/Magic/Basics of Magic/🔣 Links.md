For a spellcaster to be able to use magic, they need a link, a connection to the soul of the element they are using.

The most basic and simple link a caster can make, is symbols and runes in the form of a text, or a set of instructions. These instructions tell the soul what the caster wants to do, and interprets it and turns it into a spell. People can use anything as a link. As long as the soul, and the caster both understand and agree on a link, that link is made and can be used by the caster.

It is also possible to make spells get cast automatically, under a condition. This, however, is difficult and requires skill in making links.

Types of links:

|             Link name             |                                                                                                                                                                                             Link Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| <font size=5>     **Inscription** | The most basic link for casting spells, and many mages' starting link, as it is easy to learn and cast. Writing the spell's instructions onto any surface. The inscription can be any language, as long as a clear meaning is conveyed from the writer. It lacks complexity however, as each aspect of the created spell needs to be written down, meaning its quite time consuming to do complex spells. |
