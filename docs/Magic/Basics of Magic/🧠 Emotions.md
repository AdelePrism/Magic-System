Spellcasters exchange their emotions to the souls of magic, and get magic in return. Constant use of magic can numb the caster emotionally. Constant use of magic lowers the emotions the body experiences, so the body will begin making more, leading to spellcasters usually being more emotional than non casters. Emotion is like a resource that gets consumed to make magic, and is gradually restored on its own. Emotions is defined and measurable by the souls of magic

Specific emotions are not tied to any one element. Each element uses emotions as a whole to cast spells.

Because of the way magic influences the body, spellcasters will find similarities between their personalities and the elements they use.
