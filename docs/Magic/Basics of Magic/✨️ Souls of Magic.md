For each element of magic, there is an unknowable and omnipresent force that represent that element, the soul of the element. In exchange for the casters emotions, the soul offers magic to the caster, and the two parties work together to create spells and other magical effects.

The souls transform emotions into magic, which the soul returns to the caster. Each soul consumes any kind of emotion, but do so in differing ways that represent their element.

###  An interface for magic
The souls of magic are intelligent, and wish to experience the world through spells. A soul will help a caster make what they want, but will not do it for them. They act as an interface between casters and the spells/magic they make.

If a caster makes a spell, the soul of magic can remember the spell and simplify it so that its cast on command. For example, an earth/shock dual mage can make a coil, and run electricity through it, making an electromagnet. The soul of magic can take this and simplify it, so after the mage has done it once, they can manipulate magnetism as they can earth and shock individually.
