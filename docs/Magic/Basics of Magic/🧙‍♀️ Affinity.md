Each Individual has a different affinity for magic. The vast majority of people have barely enough affinity for magic to improve quality of life, but not close to enough to be used effectively in combat. A persons affinity with a each element is individual and separate, although usually a person would only have an affinity with one element. The element someone may have an affinity with is hereditary, a flame mage's children will also be flame mages. However, the affinity of said children varies a lot more between individuals, with a smaller hereditary factor. A flame mage with strong affinity may have a child that is unable to cast even a small spark.

In the rare cases someone has more than one affinity, the individual inherits them from their parents or bloodline. Example below.

**Grandparents affinities:**

| ðŸŒ¿ Nature | ðŸŒ™ Night | ðŸŒ¿ Nature | ðŸª¨ Earth |
| --------- | -------- | --------- | -------- |
**Parents affinities:**

| ðŸŒ¿           Nature | ðŸª¨            Earth |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
Most likely to be a nature mage, but closely followed by earth mage, however, night mage is also possible, just not as likely. In theory is able to have all 3 affinities.
