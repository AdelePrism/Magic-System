**Shock represents high speed, flashy moves, large amounts of energy released in a short time, and electricity and current.
In its purest form, Shock speeds up any movement and fills the surrounding area with negative or positive charge, resulting in crackling from electric shocks occurring.**

**Examples for using the Shock element:**
- Increased speed in physical movements like running, punching, etc.
- Creating bolts of lightning to strike a point, from the sky or the caster.
- Electric orbs that can stun whoever it hits.
- Can make batteries and small machines.
- Can negatively or positively charge objects
- Taken to its absolute limit, it could be possible to briefly slow, or stop the flow of time from the perspective of the caster(s).
