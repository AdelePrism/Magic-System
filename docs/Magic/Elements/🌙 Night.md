**Night represents suffering and pain, illusions, necromancy, darkness and shadows, but also moonlight and serenity.
In its purest form, Night will make shadows darker and start to dance, and will make people tired or scared.**

**Examples for using the Night element:**
- Inflicting pain directly or instilling fear, or calming someone down.
- Making people fall asleep, and causing nightmares.
- Causing illusions and disguising self or others.
- Can overshadow light, darkening a room.
- Communicating or interacting with shadows and undead.
- Creating undead from corpses.
