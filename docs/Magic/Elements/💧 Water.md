**Water represents adaptability and resourcefulness, as well as control over water, ice and steam.
In its purest form, water will start to form in the surrounding area, making the air very humid and everything wet.**

**Examples for using the Water element:**  
- Making structures out of ice.  
- Making projectiles or platforms out of ice.  
- Making waves and allowing faster movement in water.  
- Creating water from nothing, and forcing any state of water to turn into any other state, Ice to water to steam for example.  
- Extracting water from something that contains it, or purifying water.  
- General manipulation of water and its states.  
- Taken to its absolute limit, it could be possible to manipulate gravity.  
- Rearranging atoms to make basic elements (Carbon and Oxygen into carbon dioxide)
- Repairing objects or tools
- Giving properties to objects, for example making something more durable or making it weigh less. Combined with other elements allows for more complex properties utilizing both elements
