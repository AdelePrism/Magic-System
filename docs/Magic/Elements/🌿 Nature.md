**Nature represents all forms of life, and a connection between the user and the lifeforms around them
In its purest form, Nature will accelerate plant growth immensely, spread vines and roots in the surrounding area, and make everyone around feel more "alive".**

**Examples for using the Nature element:**
- Growing plants or roots quickly to make a wall or structure.
- Healing wounds or accelerating the natural healing process of the body.
- Using photosynthesis to make energy to be used for magic or to fuel the body.
- Communicating with lifeforms or influencing their decisions.
- Sensing lifeforms or sensing intent of said lifeforms.
- Engineer diseases or bacteria, or curing things of disease.
