**Wind represents fluid motion, misdirection and concealment, music or vibrations, and air or atmosphere.
In its purest form, Wind will cause gusts to form, and vibrate the air in a way that sounds like a flute or the piping from a steaming pot.**

**Examples for using the Wind element:**
- Redirecting attacks to make them miss their target.
- Making music, magical or non-magical.
- Affect sound to make louder or more silent.
- Can redirect light around an object, making it invisible.
- Can lift things off the ground, allowing flight.
- Make powerful winds to move things.
