The "Lightning Bolt" spell is a standardized concept of a spell, taught out to all students at the [⚡️ Shock](<../../../Magic/Elements/⚡️ Shock.md>) Academy. It is a type of spell that has a very precise and accurate, powerful bolt of lightning to attack an opponent. Because its a type of spell, it cant be imitated and can only work as a general direction for students to go in, so there are a lot of different variants. Anything from quickly executable, medium strength blasts that mostly knocks stuff around rather than damage, to a long charge time, thin pulverizing laser that uses a lot of emotion in one go, to even bringing a thunder bolt from the clouds above down onto an opponent, all count as a valid "Lightning Bolt" spell
