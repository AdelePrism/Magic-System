The "Heal" spell is a standardized concept of a spell, used usually by [ðŸ”† Daylight](<../../../Magic/Elements/ðŸ”† Daylight.md>) and [ðŸŒ¿ Nature](<../../../Magic/Elements/ðŸŒ¿ Nature.md>) mages. It is a type of spell that is used to cure wounds or accelerate healing of the body, the caster's or otherwise. Due to its nature as a spell, there is not one single type of heal spell, and the extent of its use varies from each other version. It can be a simple closing of an open wound, an extensive cure to common diseases to even growing new limbs. Most daylight and nature mages are taught to make a heal spell due to its usefulness. Most large towns and nearly every city has at least one mage with a heal spell, with each mage deciding themselves if they want to charge money for it, do it for free when asked, or even roam the surrounding area looking for creatures who need their aid.
