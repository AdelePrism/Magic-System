Vampires are a humanoid species that humans turn into, but only in rare occasions. This being when a particularly adept [ðŸŒ™ Night](<../../Magic/Elements/ðŸŒ™ Night.md>) mage inscribes a ritual to make them a vampire. This can be for many reasons, as there are many benefits to being a vampire, but there are also some downsides.

Vampires age a lot slower, or could even stop aging completely if the ritual is done flawlessly.
