### Trigger
- Holding her hand(s) against a living creature's body.
- Describing what she wants to do with the selected area.
### Effect
- The "selected" area is everything that is under the hand(s), going through the body until it exits on the other side, as to allow her to cure things under the skin.
- Artemis has a couple different words that do specific things for her so that she doesn't need to specify each time.
	- "Diagnose" gives her a clear visualization and understanding of what is happening in the selected area, helping her figure out what is wrong and how to solve it.
	- "Heal" closes any open wounds, recovers lost blood by copying the blood in the selected area, repairs any tissue or bone damage and moves anything out of place towards where its supposed to be, as well as removing anything that isn't part of the body from it.
	- "Cure" implants a customized bacteria
