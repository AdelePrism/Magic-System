**Element(s):** [🌿 Nature](<../../../Magic/Elements/🌿 Nature.md>)
### Trigger
- Holding her hand(s) against a living creature's body readies the spell.
- Saying either "Analyze", "Heal", or "Mend" triggers it.
### Effect
- The spell has different effects dependent on the word Artemis uses.
	- "*Analyze*" gives her a clear visualization and understanding of what is happening in the selected area, helping her figure out what is wrong and how to solve it.
	- "*Heal*" expels anything not part of the body from the selected wound, before closing any open wounds, and recovers lost blood by copying the blood in the selected area.
	- "*Mend*" repairs any tissue damage and bone fractures, as well as moving anything out of place towards where its supposed to be.
### Notes
- This is Artemis' variation of a [❇ Heal Spell](<../../../World/Society/Stereotypes/❇ Heal Spell.md>).
- The "selected" area is everything that is under the hand(s), going through the body until it exits on the other side, as to allow her to cure things under the skin.
