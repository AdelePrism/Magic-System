**Element(s):** [ðŸŒ¿ Nature](<../../../Magic/Elements/ðŸŒ¿ Nature.md>)
### Trigger
- Putting her hands together and saying the name of a type of wood she knows, materializes that type of wood and levitates it between her hands.
- Moving her fingers in swift slicing motions carves the wood.
### Effect
- Materializes a chunk of wood in the size she makes with her hands, in the type that she specifies.
	- Can only materialize small chunks of wood around the size of a large dagger.
- The slicing motion she makes with her hands causes the chunk of wood to be sliced in that specified spot, following the motion of the finger.
	- This allows specific cuts to be made easily, by nature of not needing to fit a physical object into the wood, which allows Artemis to outperform traditional woodcarving.
### Notes
- Artemis needs to have properly studied a type of wood in person to be able to accurately recreate it with this spell. Currently, she only knows how to materialize oak and birch wood.
- She can carve any kind of wood if she is holding it in her hands already.
- She uses this spell to carve arrows for her bow, as well as tools she needs. Artemis also occasionally makes general woodcarvings or sculptures.
- Artemis rotates the piece of wood by turning her hands around it.
