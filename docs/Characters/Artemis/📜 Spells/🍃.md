**Element(s):** [ðŸŒª Wind](<../../../Magic/Elements/ðŸŒª Wind.md>), [ðŸŒ¿ Nature](<../../../Magic/Elements/ðŸŒ¿ Nature.md>)
### Trigger
- The spell can be triggered by either Artemis moving her hands in a slow swaying motion, or she can trigger the spell whenever she wants if she is already using [ðŸŽ¶ Melody of the Wind](<ðŸŽ¶ Melody of the Wind.md>)
### Effect
- Picks up leaves in front of her with Wind magic, and makes them float in the direction she moves her hands in. She can use this to send leaves in a circular motion around an area, or to have them follow a set path. The leaves stop moving only after she actively stops using the spell.
- If she is using the spell while using Melody of the Wind, the leaves float and dart around to the music she is playing, and fall gently to the ground when she stops.
### Notes
- Artemis uses this spell for adding flair and atmosphere to a situation.
- She also uses it when dancing on her own, sometimes dancing while using both this spell and Melody of the Wind.
