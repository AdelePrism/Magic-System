**Element(s):** [ðŸŒª Wind](<../../../Magic/Elements/ðŸŒª Wind.md>)
### Trigger
- Holding her hands up as if to play an invisible ocarina readies the spell.
- If she makes a sound with her mouth during this, it triggers the spell.
### Effect
- Any sound she makes with her mouth will be altered to sound like she is playing an ocarina.
- She can use this to play music anytime she wants.
### Notes
- Artemis often uses this spell recreationally, as playing music is one of her hobbies.
- The spell due to its simplicity is very efficient, and hardly uses any emotion to do as its simply vibrating the air coming out of her mouth.
