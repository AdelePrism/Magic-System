## Personal Details
Artemis is a wandering healer and witch. She has long sunset blonde hair, and is around 6'2. 

Artemis is very caring and empathetic, and has a bit of a "motherly" personality, which leads her to get very defensive and protective of people she cares about. She is observant and notices small details that are easily missed, but she is overly optimistic and a bit naive, which causes her to ignore signs that someone isn't to be trusted.
