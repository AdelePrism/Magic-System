## Personal Details
Artemis is a wandering healer and witch. She has long sunset blonde hair, and is around 6'2. 

Artemis is very caring and empathetic, and has a bit of a "motherly" nature, which leads her to get very defensive and protective of people she cares about. She is observant and notices small details that are easily missed, but she is overly optimistic and a bit naive, which causes her to ignore signs that someone isn't to be trusted.

Artemis is both a Nature and Wind mage. While her offensive and defensive spells utilize both elements, Nature is used primarily for support and defence while Wind is used more for offence. She also enjoys using Wind to play music recreationally, often sounding like an ocarina to play peaceful melodies.

She carries a shortbow she made herself, and creates thin wooden arrows to use as ammo, so her fighting style is more of a ranged attacker and tends to take on more of a support role when fighting with other people.
