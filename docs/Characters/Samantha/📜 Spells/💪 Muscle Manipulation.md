**Element(s):** [⚡️ Shock](<../../../Magic/Elements/⚡️ Shock.md>)
### Trigger
- Focus on a specific point in space either visible or known, as well as snapping fingers.
- Focused point is typically a specific muscle.
### Effect
- Create a very small spark, of the same strength as the brain sends to control muscles. 
- Spark appears in the focused spot, and forces the muscle to contract unwillingly.
### Notes
- Most of the energy in this spell is used to cast this spell precisely, even across longer distances. 
- It gets used to disrupt attacks, melee or ranged, but can also be used to prevent movements or blocking of Samantha's attacks.
- Might have some potential with manipulating her own muscles to make her body move on its own.
