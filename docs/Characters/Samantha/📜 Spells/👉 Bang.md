**Element(s):** [⚡️ Shock](<Magic/Elements/⚡️ Shock.md>)
### Trigger
- Hand shaped like a finger gun pointed in the general direction, and focus on a specific point of impact readies the spell.
- Pretending to fire the gun triggers the spell.
### Effect
- Make a small lightning bolt from index fingertip to point of impact.
- There is a small explosion at the point or impact, as if thunder struck it.
### Notes
- Samantha's variation of a [⚡️Lightning Bolt Spell](<World/Society/Stereotypes/⚡️Lightning Bolt Spell.md>).
- Most of the energy of the spell is in the explosion that occurs in the point of impact, the lightning bolt itself is barely visible.
- The finger does not need to be aiming directly at it, just in the general direction.
- You will rarely see Samantha using this spell.
