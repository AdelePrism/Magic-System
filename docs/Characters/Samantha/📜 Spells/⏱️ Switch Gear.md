**Element(s):** [⚡️ Shock](<../../../Magic/Elements/⚡️ Shock.md>)
### Trigger
- Clearly thinking the phrase "Gear" Followed by a percentage.
- Spell wont deactivate until she sets the gear to 0 or she runs out of emotion.
### Effect
- Speeds up Samantha by the percentage specified, 0% being the default speed and 100% being twice as fast.
- Cannot go below 0.
### Notes
- Consumes a lot of magic, which is directly tied to how much she is sped up by. 
- Can be used over 100% to speed up even more, but is very draining to do so.
