# ℹ️ Info
### Personal Details
Samantha is an aspiring witch. She has long, sunset blonde hair and is quite tall and skinny.

She is impatient and hasty, if she sees the solution to a problem, she won't hesitate to do it herself. She is also stubborn, and insists on doing things her way, even if there is a better option.

### Magic Ability
**Affinities:** Shock
**Links:** Somatic, Inscription, Mental

Samantha is particularly gifted, and has a strong affinity with her element, Shock. She also has mental links, which is a rare skill among mages. Despite this, she insists on fighting up close rather than the more advantageous lightning bolt, common among Shock mages for its long range and precision. Due to societal pressure, Samantha reluctantly learned a ranged attack, but she rarely uses it, out of spite. 

Samantha's spells revolve around being faster than her opponent, disorienting them and landing blows quickly. She uses a lot of emotion in battle to end fights quickly. This makes her vulnerable to longer fights and redheads.
