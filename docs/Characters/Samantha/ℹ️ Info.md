## Magic Ability
<font size=2>Affinities: [⚡️ Shock](<Magic/Elements/⚡️ Shock.md>)  </font>

Samantha is particularly gifted, and has a strong affinity with her element, Shock. She also has mental links, which is a rare skill among mages. Despite this, she insists on fighting up close rather than the more advantageous lightning bolt, common among Shock mages for its long range and precision. Due to academic standards and societal pressure, Samantha reluctantly learned a ranged attack, but she rarely uses it, out of spite. 

Samantha's spells revolve around being faster than her opponent, disorienting them and landing blows quickly. She uses a lot of emotion in battle to end fights quickly. This makes her vulnerable to longer fights.
