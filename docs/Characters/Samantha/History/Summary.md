Samantha grew up in a small town, but from very early on she revealed herself to be quite adept at shock magic. This lead to her getting sent to a city with a Shock mage academy, and getting enrolled. The academy was very standardized and taught exclusively shock mages. Samantha's teacher was stubborn and did not like the branches of shock magic that were not directly lightning and electricity. By the end of the final year, every student is required to have a sufficient "[‚ö°Ô∏èLightning Bolt Spell](<../../../World/Society/Stereotypes/‚ö°Ô∏èLightning Bolt Spell.md>)" to graduate. Samantha dislikes this, because her proficiency in shock magic is mostly the aspects of velocity and speed. Her defiance affected her grades, as her form of magic wasn't counted as doing the coursework properly. This only further alienated her from her peers and from the academy. She exclusively worked on her own spells rather than what was expected of her. When she was nearing the end of her time at the academy, she made a simple ranged spell ([üëâ Bang](<../üìú Spells/üëâ Bang.md>)) that barely fit the requirements. Because of this, she was able to graduate at the age of 19, and went out traveling to learn more about magic and improve her skills. After 6 months of adventuring, she met [Artemis](<../../Artemis/index.md>), and they decided to travel together.
