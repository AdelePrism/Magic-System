Samantha grew up in a small town, but from very early on she revealed herself to be quite adept at shock magic. This lead to her getting sent to a city with a Shock mage academy, and getting enrolled. The academy was very standardized and taught exclusively shock mages. It had the ideology that Shock magic was exclusively the "electricity" and did not acknowledge the other aspects of the magic. Every student needed a sufficient "[‚ö°Ô∏èLightning Bolt Spell](<World/Society/Stereotypes/‚ö°Ô∏èLightning Bolt Spell.md>)" to graduate. Samantha dislikes the ideology of the academy, and her proficiency in shock magic is mostly the aspects of velocity and speed, the opposite of the academy. Her defiance affected her grades, as her form of magic wasn't counted as doing the coursework properly. This only further alienated her from her peers and from the academy. She exclusively worked on her own spells rather than what was expected of her. When she was nearing the end of her time at the academy, she made a simple ranged spell ([üëâ Bang](<Characters/Samantha/üìú Spells/üëâ Bang.md>)) that barely fit the requirements. Because of this, she was able to graduate at the age of 19, and since then she has been traveling and learning more advanced magic.
