## Personal Details:
Beatrix is a vampiric sorceress. She has long, platinum-white hair with subtle black lowlights at the roots. She is 6ft tall to the inch, and has a seductive form. 

Beatrix plays those in power like a fiddle, cursing and diseasing cattle, crops and children alike with uniquely crafted ailments curable only by her magic, before presenting herself as a savior and gaining the trust of her victims to achieve strength and riches all while building a foundation of manipulation and temptation beneath her.

She became a vampire at the age of 21, and so her aging has been slowed for the unknown time she has been alive, so she looks around 25. She killed the vampire who turned her as she became immediately far more powerful than he could ever have been thanks to the perfect match between her natural prowess in the Night affinity and the vampiric nature she inherited.

Beatrix primarily uses her Life spells to cause subtle chaos, silently sowing tactical seeds that benefit her long-term agenda. She also uses Life spells to come across as a Life-exclusive sorceress when she intends to hide her darker intentions, using thorned vines to fight and her knowledge of biological organisms and their energies to cure ailments and provide nurture for those she intends to build trust with.

She uses her Night spells (Which are far more powerful due to her vampiric nature to create illusions and puppets to assist her in hunting her prey, as she needs to drink blood periodically. Whilst drinking blood from a living victim, Beatrix can inject a variety of handcrafted diseases/psychedelics/sedatives her body can produce as the result of her affinities. She may also use these spells to overwhelm those who figure her out and attack her.
